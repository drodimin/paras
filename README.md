## Game: Paras

This repository contains code for a game I wrote back in 2000. At the time I was a computer science student at York University. It was written as a Java applet and intended to be played in the browser. It is inspired by old DOS game I used to play as a youngster.

Java applets are no longer supported by modern browsers. However with a help of technology by https://leaningtech.com/cheerpj/ this game can be run. This repository includes html page configured to run the applet. And it is also hosted here: https://focused-rosalind-12b855.netlify.app/paras_web.html
